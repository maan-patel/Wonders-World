# Wonders-World


## Working Application below

https://wonders-world.herokuapp.com/


## Functionality

Fully functioning **CRUD aplication** made using **JavaScript**, **Node.js** (for backend), **Express.js** (for the web framework), **MongoDB** (for storing users, **APIs**, passwords, locations, description, year, etc.),  **Password Hashing**, **Async JS** (for requests) and **HTML/CSS & Bootstrap** (for front-end).

The app displays the top 50 wonders in the world. Furthermore, it allows a user to Register/ Login and add their wonder in their world. The user can add an image, description, location, and more. The user can also Edit, Update, and Delete their wonder. Only the user who created a wonder can delete it. 

The code is in production env and hence ".env" file for env variables and passwords have been ignored.
